# PETSIRD basic Python example

This directory contains some instructions to wrote Python code to read/write PETSIRD data. You need to `yardl generate` in the `model` directory first.

As we currently do not have a `set_up.py` for PETSIRD yet, the example file hard-codes the path to the generated files.
Alternatives would be to use the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or symbolic links.

## Instructions for testing STIR conversion to PETSIRD (WIP)

List mode data should be stored in the `data` directory as the script is hardcoding this for now.
